# Rc-car
This repository contains some basic scripts for learning to work with a Raspberry Pi in Python, as well as scripts for controlling a remote-controlled (RC) car using a keyboard or a joystick. 

The car also carries a camera, so there is a script that opens the camera and displays on our screen what the camera sees.
